## Possession: Concept and kinds of possession
*‘Possession’* implies that one has physical control over an object or thing. Generally, it expresses the closest and immediate relation of the fact that can exist between a thing and the person possessing it. However, in the legal terms, possession is not only limited to physical control rather extends to include an intention to exercise that physical control. Possession is prime evidence of transferring ownership. 

**Definition:**  The concept of possession is though basic and essential in human life, it is a difficult to define. Some Jurists have given different definitions.

1. ***John Salmond:*** Salmond defines Possession as, “possession is the continuing exercise of a claim to the Exclusive use of an object.”

2. ***Savigny:*** Savigny defines Possession as, “intention coupled with physical power to exclude others from the use of material object.

**Elements of Possession:** Corpus Possidendi and Animus Possidendi are two elements of possession

1. ***Corpus Possidendi:*** Physical control over the possessed object.

2. ***Animus Possidendi:*** Intention or will to exercise the power.

**Types of possession:**

1. ***Corporeal Possession:*** Those things/objects that constitute physical or material existence and have a direct relationship with that thing, are referred to as incorporeal possession. For eg. Pen, car, house, book etc.

2. ***Incorporeal Possession:*** Those things/objects that does not constitute any physical or material existence and cannot be felt by senses are referred to as incorporeal possession. For eg, Patent, Goodwill, Trademark etc.

3. ***De facto Possession:*** It is also known as Possession in fact. Such possession exists whenever an individual is in immediate possession of the object/thing and in the exclusion of others. This possession is not lawfully recognized but it exists in reality.

4. ***De jure Possession:*** It is also known as Possession in law or Juridical Possession. Such possession exists whenever an individual claims the object/thing to be his own through the legal way by occupying it without having any argument as to his legal right of possessing that thing. This possession is lawfully recognized irrespective of the fact of whether it exists in reality or not.

5. ***Mediate Possession:*** It is also called Indirect Possession. Mediate Possession is one where the property/thing is possessed through a mediator which can be either friend, servant or any agent. In this case, there is a lesser degree of physical control with the possessor as the possession over object/ thing is with another person.

6. ***Immediate Possession:*** It is also called Direct Possession. Immediate Possession is one where the property/thing is possessed by the possessor himself. In this case, there is a higher degree of physical control with the possessor as the possession over object/ thing is with the same person.

7. ***Constructive Possession:*** Wright and Pollock defined Constructive Possession as the one which arises only by construction of law. It is not possession in fact but it certainly is possession in law.

8. ***Adverse Possession:*** It refers to holding of the land/immovable property of any other party on his own behalf. When Adverse Possession continues without any hindrance or obstruction for a certain period of time, the person holding the property can claim for it thereby subsequently extinguishing the true owners’ rights.
