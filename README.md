## Possession: Concept and kinds of possession
*‘Possession’* implies that one has physical control over an object or thing. Generally, it expresses the closest and immediate relation of the fact that can exist between a thing and the person possessing it. However, in the legal terms, possession is not only limited to physical control rather extends to include an intention to exercise that physical control. Possession is prime evidence of transferring ownership. 

**Definition:**  The concept of possession is though basic and essential in human life, it is a difficult to define. Some Jurists have given different definitions.

1. ***John Salmond:*** Salmond defines Possession as, “possession is the continuing exercise of a claim to the Exclusive use of an object.”

2. ***Savigny:*** Savigny defines Possession as, “intention coupled with physical power to exclude others from the use of material object.

**Elements of Possession:** Corpus Possidendi and Animus Possidendi are two elements of possession

1. ***Corpus Possidendi:*** Physical control over the possessed object.

2. ***Animus Possidendi:*** Intention or will to exercise the power.

**Types of possession:**

1. ***Corporeal Possession:*** Those things/objects that constitute physical or material existence and have a direct relationship with that thing, are referred to as incorporeal possession. For eg. Pen, car, house, book etc.

2. ***Incorporeal Possession:*** Those things/objects that does not constitute any physical or material existence and cannot be felt by senses are referred to as incorporeal possession. For eg, Patent, Goodwill, Trademark etc.

3. ***De facto Possession:*** It is also known as Possession in fact. Such possession exists whenever an individual is in immediate possession of the object/thing and in the exclusion of others. This possession is not lawfully recognized but it exists in reality.

4. ***De jure Possession:*** It is also known as Possession in law or Juridical Possession. Such possession exists whenever an individual claims the object/thing to be his own through the legal way by occupying it without having any argument as to his legal right of possessing that thing. This possession is lawfully recognized irrespective of the fact of whether it exists in reality or not.

5. ***Mediate Possession:*** It is also called Indirect Possession. Mediate Possession is one where the property/thing is possessed through a mediator which can be either friend, servant or any agent. In this case, there is a lesser degree of physical control with the possessor as the possession over object/ thing is with another person.

6. ***Immediate Possession:*** It is also called Direct Possession. Immediate Possession is one where the property/thing is possessed by the possessor himself. In this case, there is a higher degree of physical control with the possessor as the possession over object/ thing is with the same person.

7. ***Constructive Possession:*** Wright and Pollock defined Constructive Possession as the one which arises only by construction of law. It is not possession in fact but it certainly is possession in law.

8. ***Adverse Possession:*** It refers to holding of the land/immovable property of any other party on his own behalf. When Adverse Possession continues without any hindrance or obstruction for a certain period of time, the person holding the property can claim for it thereby subsequently extinguishing the true owners’ rights.

## Understanding Poverty: Causes, Forms, and Remedies

Poverty, a complex and multifaceted issue, plagues millions in India as well as worldwide While definitions vary, it generally refers to the inability to meet basic needs for survival and well-being. Understanding its causes, forms, and potential remedies is crucial for finding effective solutions.

**Causes of Poverty:**

1. ***Economic Disparity:*** Unequal distribution of wealth and resources significantly contribute to poverty. Limited access to land, capital, and financial services restricts income-generating opportunities, trapping individuals in poverty cycles.
2. ***Education Gap:*** Lack of proper education and skills creates barriers to employment and reduces earning potential. Limited access to quality education perpetuates poverty across generations.
3. ***Social Exclusion:*** Marginalized groups often face discrimination and exclusion from essential services and opportunities, hindering their ability to escape poverty. Gender inequality, social hierarchies, and disabilities can further exacerbate this effect.
4. ***Conflict and Disasters:*** Wars, natural disasters, and political instability can destroy infrastructure, livelihoods, and access to resources, pushing communities into poverty. The impact is often long-lasting, hindering recovery efforts.
5. ***Health Issues:*** Poor health undermines individuals' ability to work and earn, creating a vicious cycle. Inadequate access to healthcare, malnutrition, and chronic illnesses disproportionately affect low-income populations.

**Forms of Poverty:**

1. ***Income Poverty:*** Measured by the inability to afford basic necessities like food, shelter, clothing, and healthcare. It is often quantified by income thresholds set by national or international organizations.
2. ***Multidimensional Poverty:*** Recognizes the complex interplay of various deprivations beyond income, including education, health, sanitation, and access to information. This holistic approach provides a broader understanding of poverty's impact.
3. ***Vulnerability and Risk:*** Focuses on the susceptibility to falling into or remaining in poverty due to unexpected events like illness, job loss, or natural disasters. This acknowledges the dynamic nature of poverty and the need for social safety nets.
4. ***Hidden Poverty:*** Refers to situations where poverty is masked by seemingly adequate income but conceals underlying deprivations in other aspects of life, such as lack of quality education or social capital.
5. ***Chronic vs. Transitory Poverty:*** Chronic poverty refers to long-term deprivation, while transitory poverty describes shorter periods of hardship potentially overcome through temporary support. Understanding this distinction is crucial for designing effective interventions.

**Remedies for Poverty:**

1. ***Economic Empowerment:*** Promoting access to resources and opportunities like microfinance, vocational training, and fair market access empowers individuals to generate income and improve their livelihoods.
2. ***Education for All:*** Ensuring quality education, especially for girls, equips individuals with the skills and knowledge needed to secure better jobs and contribute to economic growth.
3. ***Social Protection:*** Implementing safety nets like social security, unemployment benefits, and healthcare access protects individuals from falling into poverty due to unforeseen circumstances.
4. ***Inclusive Development:*** Policies and programs that address systemic inequalities and promote inclusivity in governance, social services, and economic opportunities are crucial for creating a fairer society where everyone benefits.
5. ***Sustainable Development:*** Investing in sustainable practices that address climate change, environmental degradation, and resource management ensures long-term stability and reduces vulnerabilities that push communities into poverty.

**Conclusion:** Addressing poverty requires a comprehensive and multi-pronged approach that tackles its root causes and empowers individuals and communities. By understanding the different forms of poverty and implementing evidence-based solutions, we can build a more just and equitable world where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. It is crucial to remember that tackling poverty is not just about charity, but about creating a system where everyone has a fair chance to succeed.

    - SLSAs monitor the implementation of legal aid schemes and programs within their state. They prepare annual reports outlining their activities, achievements, and challenges faced (Section 25).

Through their dedicated efforts, they strive to fulfill the promise of a truly inclusive and just Indian society.
